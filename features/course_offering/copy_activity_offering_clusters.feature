  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a Schedule Coordinator

  Scenario: Copy course offering and ensure default activity offering cluster is copied
    Given I have created the default registration groups for a course offering
    When I copy the course offering
    Then the activity offering cluster and assigned AOs are copied over with the course offering
    And the registration groups are not copied

  Scenario: Copy course offering and ensure constrained activity offering clusters are copied
    Given I have created an activity offering cluster and generated registration groups for a course offering
    When I copy the course offering
    Then the activity offering clusters and assigned AOs are copied over with the course offering
    And the registration groups are not copied

  Scenario: Create course offering by copying from a previous term and ensure default activity offering cluster is copied
    Given I have created the default registration groups for a catalog course offering
    When I create a new course offering in a subsequent term by copying the catalog course offering
    Then the activity offering cluster and assigned AOs are copied over with the course offering
    And the registration groups are not copied
