  Scenario: Test whether statement deleted in compound is removed from the tree
    When I edit the data for "Student Eligibility & Prerequisite" for term "201208" and course "PHYS275"
    And I want to edit the previously edited section
    And I delete node "K" in the tree
    Then there should be no node "K" on both tabs

    And I click on the edited section
    Then the "agenda" preview section should not have the text "Must have successfully completed a minimum of 1 course from,HIST210,HIST395"
