Feature: SA.ELIG8-23 Ensure that changes made to AO or CO Requisites displays differently on S0C Reg Group
  ELIG 8.23 : As a Central Administrator I want to have Rules display in the Schedule of Classes Registration Group
  View so that students are able to see whether or not they will qualify for enrolment in a course prior to trying
  to enrol

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as admin

  #ELIG8.22.EB1 (KSENROLL-10123)
  @pending
  Scenario: Test that suppressing the Corequisite rule for AO A only displays on the Schedule of Classes for the AO
    Given I suppress the rule in the Student Eligibilty & Prerequisite section
    And I am using the schedule of classes page
    When I search for course offerings by course in the CHEM subject group to view the registration group
    Then the course offering requisites should be displayed not stating "Prerequisite.*CHEM241 and CHEM242.*CHEM247.*A grade of C- or better"
    And Activity J in the Registration Group has Activity Offering Requisites displayed stating "Prerequisite.*CHEM241 and CHEM242.*CHEM247.*A grade of C- or better"

  #ELIG8.22.EB2 (KSENROLL-10123)
  @pending
  Scenario: Test that editing the Corequisite rule is displayed on the Schedule of Classes
    Given I edit the Corequisite section by adding a new text statement
    And I am using the schedule of classes page
    When I search for course offerings by course in the CHEM subject group to view the registration group
    Then the course offering requisites should be displayed not stating "Corequisite.*CHEM271.*Changed the Corequisite on AO V only"
    And Activity C in the Registration Group has Activity Offering Requisites displayed stating "Corequisite.*CHEM271.*Changed the Corequisite on AO V only"

  Scenario: Test that adding CO Requisites is displayed on the Schedule of Classes
    Given I add a new text statement to the Antirequisite section
    And I am using the schedule of classes page
    When I search for course offerings by course in the CHEM subject group to view the registration group
    Then the added course offering requisite should be displayed with the course data
    And Activity J in the Registration Group has Activity Offering Requisites displayed not stating "Antirequisite.*Added Antirequisite on CO level"
