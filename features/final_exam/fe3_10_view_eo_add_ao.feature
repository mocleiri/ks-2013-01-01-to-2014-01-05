Feature: SA.FE3-10 View Exam Offerings after added more Activity Offerings
  FE 3.10: As a Central Administrator I want to create AO driven exam offerings dynamically after the bulk creation
  so that new exam offerings will be created as new Activity Offerings are created

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as admin

  #FE3.10.EB1 (KSENROLL-9789)
  Scenario: Test whether the View EO table loads the same number of Exam Offerings as there are Activity Offerings
    When I view the Exam Offerings for a CO with two AOs and a standard final exam driven by Activity Offering
    Then there should be 2 Exam Offerings by Activity Offering for the course

  #FE3.10.EB2 (KSENROLL-9789)
  Scenario: Test whether adding more AOs will add two more Exam Offerings in the View EO table
    When I view the Exam Offerings for a CO with two new AOs and a standard final exam driven by Activity Offering
    Then there should be 4 Exam Offerings by Activity Offering for the course

  #FE3.10.EB3 (KSENROLL-9789)
  Scenario: Test whether adding two more AOs to a CO and then creating a copy shows the correct number of EOs in the View EO table
    When I create a CO with two new AOs and then view the Exam Offerings where the CO has a standard final exam driven by Activity Offering
    Then there should be 4 Exam Offerings by Activity Offering for the course
